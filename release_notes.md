# What's New

- The AI Assistant can now understand and respond to context sensitive conversations and perform given SOC tasks.

    - With bot's enhanced understanding of the natural language, it now derives its operating modes from the conversation; making the options &mdash; Playbook Blocks and Conversation Mode &mdash; redundant.

    - The bot now has increased access to various modules, maintaining privacy is paramount. Sensitive data is still being actively masked for all interactions with the LLM.

    - The bot can now hold conversations to understand requirements and generate a more targeted playbook.

    - Through enhanced comprehension, the bot can also navigate to modules, its records, and playbook logs; in addition to alert investigation, remediation, escalation to incident, and even setting up war rooms, among several others.

    - The bot now asks questions if it needs more information or context to perform a task. For example, in response to block an indicator, it asks for the indicator's value, type, and reason for blocking.

- Previous conversations remain in the conversation window and help provide context to the bot, until users clear the conversation. The conversations persist throughout repeated logins and logouts.
